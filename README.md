Linear Regression Practice with American Housing Dataset
This project serves as a hands-on practice exercise for implementing linear regression using the American Housing Dataset. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate housing prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc. This README provides an overview of the project, dataset, implementation details, and usage instructions.

Introduction
Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). In this project, we apply linear regression to the American Housing Dataset to predict housing prices based on various factors.

Dataset
The American Housing Dataset contains information about housing prices and related attributes for various houses across different regions in the United States. It includes features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location (latitude and longitude), and more. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

Implementation
The linear regression model is implemented using Python and popular data science libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. The implementation involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables if necessary.
Feature Selection: Identifying relevant features that are likely to influence housing prices.
Model Training: Using the training data to fit the linear regression model to the input features and target variable.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), R-squared (R2), and visualizations.
Evaluation
The performance of the linear regression model is evaluated using various metrics to gauge its accuracy and generalization capabilities. These metrics include:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual housing prices.
R-squared (R2) Score: Indicates the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
Usage
To use the linear regression model for predicting housing prices:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies specified in requirements.txt.
Load the dataset and preprocess it as necessary.
Train the linear regression model using the provided training data.
Evaluate the trained model's performance using the testing data.
Make predictions on new data to estimate housing prices.
Refer to the provided documentation and example scripts for detailed instructions on using the linear regression model.
